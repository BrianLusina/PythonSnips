Implement the method isSortedAndHow, which accepts an array of integers, and returns one of the following:

'yes, ascending' - if the numbers in the array are sorted in an ascending way
'yes, descending' - if the numbers in the array are sorted in a descending way
'no' You can assume the array will always be valid, and there will always be one correct answer.
