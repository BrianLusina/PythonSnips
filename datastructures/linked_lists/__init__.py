        Uses two pointers where last pointer will be moved until it points to the last node in the linked list.
        The second pointer, previous, will point to the second last node in the linked list.

        Complexity Analysis:

        An assumption is made where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
        - Time: O(n) as the the pointers have to be moved through each node in the linked list until both point to the
        last and second last nodes in the linked list

        - Space O(1) as no extra space is incurred in the iteration. Only pointers are moved at the end to move the tail
         node to the head and make the second to last node the new tail

        Partitions a LinkedList around a data point such that all nodes with values less than this data point come
        before all nodes greater than or equal to that data point

        Algorithm:
        - Create left & right LinkedLists
        - For each element/node in the linked list:
            - if element data < data:
                - append to the left list
            - if element data is equal to the data:
                - prepend to the right list
            - if element data is greater than the data:
                - append to the right list
        - Check if the left list is empty. Return right list if left is empty
        - Move the pointer of the left list up to the last node (O(n) operation)
        - set the next pointer of the last node in the left list to the head of the right list
        - return the head of the left list

        Complexity Analysis:
