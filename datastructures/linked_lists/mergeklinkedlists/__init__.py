    """
    Merges two sorted linked list into 1 sorted linked list. Note that the assumption here is that the 2 linked lists
    are already sorted. If either of the heads of the linked list that is provided is None, the other head node is
    returned instead. If both are None, then none is returned.

    Complexity:
    Time O(n+m) where n is the number of nodes in 1 linked list while m is the number of nodes in the other linked list.
    This is because both linked lists have to be traversed to merge into a single linked list

    Space O(n+m) where n & m are the number of nodes in the respective linked list. This is because a new linked list
    is created from both linked lists and the nodes from each are merged into a single linke list.

    Args:
        head_one(Node): optional head node of linked list one
        head_two(Node): optional head node of linked list two
    Returns:
        Node: optional head node of merged linked list
