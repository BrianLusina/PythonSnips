## Queues

This is like a line at the Movie theatre, the first one at the line is the first one into the theatre. It follows the
principle of **FIFO**, First In, First Out.

Queues have 2 main methods:

1. `enqueue()` adds an item
2. `dequeue()` removes and returns the item in line
3. `is_empty()` checks if the queue is empty
4. `is_full()` checks if a queue is full
5. `peek()` gets the value at the front of the queue without removing it
