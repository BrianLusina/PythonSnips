## Queues

This is like a line at the Movie theatre, the first one at the line is the first one into the theatre. It follows the
principle of **FIFO**, First In, First Out.

Queues have 2 main methods:

1. enqueue() adds an item
2. dequeue() removes and returns the item in line

They could also have utility methods

1. peek(), returns an item at the front of the queue, without removing it
2. is_empty(), returns True if the queue is empty, False otherwise.
