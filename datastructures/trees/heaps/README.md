# Heaps

A heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the *heap property*, where any given node is:

1. always greater than its child node(s) and the key for the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This
   property is also called **max heap property**
2. always smaller than the child node(s) and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This
   property is also called **min heap property**

## Implementation

There are different types of heaps with different implementations:

1. [Binary Heap](./binary)
2. [Fibonacci Heap](./fibonacci)
