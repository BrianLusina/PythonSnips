# Array Advance Game

In this game, you are given an array of non-negative integers. For example:

[3,3,1,0,2,0,1]
Each number in the array represents the maximum you can advance in the array.

Now the problem is as follows:

Is it possible to advance from the start of the array to the last element given that the maximum you can advance from a
position is based on the value of the array at the index you are currently present on?
