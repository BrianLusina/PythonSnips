    Operation 1 allows us to swap any two symbols, so what matters in the end is not the order of them, but how many of each symbol we have. 
    Imagine we have (6, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6) frequencies of symbols, than we need to have the same frequencies for the second string as well. 
    So, we need to check if we have the same elements, but in different order (that is one is anagramm of another). We can do it in 2 ways. 
    We can sort both of them and compare, or we can use Counter again to check if these two lists have the same elements.
    
    Operation 2 allows us to rename our letters, but we need to use the same letters: it means, that set of letters in first and second strings should be the same.
