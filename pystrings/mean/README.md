## Mean

You will be given a list of strings which will include both integers and characters.

Return a list of length 2 with lst[0] representing the mean of the integers to a single decimal place. There will always
be 10 integers and 10 characters. Create a single string with the characters and return it as lst[1] while maintaining
the original order.

lst = ['u', '6', 'd', '1', 'i', 'w', '6', 's', 't', '4', 'a', '6', 'g', '1', '2', 'w', '8', 'o', '2', '0']
Here is an example of your return
