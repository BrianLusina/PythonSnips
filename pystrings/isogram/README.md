## isograms

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

``` python
is_isogram("Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
is_isogram("aba" ) == false
is_isogram("moOse" ) == false # -- ignore letter case
```

`([a-zA-Z])` - A letter which it captures in the first group; then

`.*?` - zero or more characters (the ? denotes as few as possible); until

`\1` - it finds a repeat of the first matched character.

#### Alternatives

Loop through each character in word and check the count of each letter, if the letter is greater than 1, it is not an isogram,
else it is

```python
def is_isogram(word):
    w = word.lower()
    for chr in w:
        if w.count(chr) > 1:
            return False
    return True

```

OR

Use a set to determine if the length of unique characters are equal to the characters already present, if they are then it is an isogram, else it is false
