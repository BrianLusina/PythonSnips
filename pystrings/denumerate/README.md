## Denumerate String

You have to rebuild a string from an enumerated list.

the function only accepts a list of tuples where each tuple consists of 2 elements the first element of the tuple will
be the index of the reconstructed string and the second element a single alphanumeric character the indexes must start
from zero and must match with how indexes are numbered normally, so gaps between indexes are not allowed tuples don't
have to be ordered by the indexes The function should return False otherwise.

Input example:

[(4,'y'),(1,'o'),(3,'t'),(0,'m'),(2,'n')]
Returns
'monty'
