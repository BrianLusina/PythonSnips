## Denumerate String
You have to rebuild a string from an enumerated list.

the function only accepts a list of tuples where each tuple consists of 2 elements
the first element of the tuple will be the index of the reconstructed string and the second element a single alphanumeric character
the indexes must start from zero and must match with how indexes are numbered normally, so gaps between indexes are not allowed
tuples don't have to be ordered by the indexes
The function should return False otherwise.

Input example:

[(4,'y'),(1,'o'),(3,'t'),(0,'m'),(2,'n')]
Returns
'monty'
