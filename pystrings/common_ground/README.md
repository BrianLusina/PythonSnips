The discussion gets heated and you are cannot risk favoring either of them as this might damage your political standing
with either of the two clans the samurai generals belong to. Thus, the only thing left to do is find what the common
ground of what they are saying is.

Compare the proposals using the function commonGround(string a, string b) that outputs a string containing the words in
string a that also occur in string b.

Each word in the reflting string shall occur once, and the order of the words follow the order of the first occurence of
each word in the second string. If they are saying nothing in common, kill both samurai and blame a ninja. (output "
death")
