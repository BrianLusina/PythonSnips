def spreadsheet_encode_column(column_id: str) -> int:
    """
    Encodes a Spreadsheet column ID as an integer and returns it. Here the encoding uses the alphabets A, B, C, etc. and
    further uses the indexing of the alphabet starting from 1 like: A=1, B=2, C=3,..., Z=26

    Complexity
    Where n represents the number of characters in the column_id

    - Time O(n) as we iterate over each character in the column ID to calculate the encoding
    - Space O(1) no extra space is required to perform the encoding

    Args:
        column_id (str): the column ID(name) as represented on a spreadsheet
    Returns:
        int: encoded column id as an integer
