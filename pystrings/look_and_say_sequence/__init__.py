    """
    Counts the number of occurrences of each character in the provided sequence and returns the count of each character
    alongside the character itself as a string in the format `cx`, where c is the count and x is the character. This
    retains the sequence order passed in and only includes the counts

    Args:
        sequence (str): sequence of characters, e.g. "11" or "121", etc

    Returns:
        str: string in the format of count of characters along with the characters themselves,
        e.g. if sequence is "1", return will be "11"

    Complexity:
    Time: O(n) where n is the number of characters in the provided sequence as the algorithm has to iterate over each
    character in the sequence
    Space: O(n) where n is the number of characters in the provided sequence. This is because the algorithm uses a list
    to store the count of characters and the characters themselves to later join into a string as the result
