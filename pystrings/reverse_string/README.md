# Reverse the String

Problem Description

You are given a string A of size N

Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:

A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.
If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.
