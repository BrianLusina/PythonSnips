I like parentheticals (a lot).
"Sometimes (when I nest them (my parentheticals) too much (like this (and this))) they get confusing."

Write a function that, given a sentence like the one above, along with the position of an opening parenthesis, finds the corresponding closing parenthesis.

Example: if the example string above is input with the number 10 (position of the first parenthesis), the output should be 79 (position of the last parenthesis).

Gotchas
We can do this in O(n)O(n) time.

We can do this in O(1)O(1) additional space.

Breakdown
How would you solve this problem by hand with an example input?

Try looping through the string, keeping a count of how many open parentheses we have.

Solution
We simply walk through the the string, starting at our input opening parenthesis position. As we iterate, we keep a count of how many additional "(" we find as open_nested_parens. When we find a ")" we decrement open_nested_parens. If we find a ")" and open_nested_parens is 0, we know that ")" closes our initial "(", so we return its position.

  def get_closing_paren(sentence, opening_paren_index):
    open_nested_parens = 0
    position = opening_paren_index + 1

    while position <= len(sentence) - 1:
        char = sentence[position]

        if char == '(':
            open_nested_parens += 1
        elif char == ')':
            if open_nested_parens == 0:
                return position
            else:
                open_nested_parens -= 1

        position += 1

    raise Exception("No closing parenthesis :(")

Complexity
O(n)O(n) time, where nn is the number of chars in the string. O(1)O(1) space.

The while loop keeps our space cost at O(1)O(1). It might be more Pythonic to use:

  for char in sentence[position:]:
Python
but then our space cost would be O(n)O(n), because in the worst case position would be 0 and we'd take a slice of the entire input.

What We Learned
The trick to many "parsing" questions like this is using a stack to track which brackets/phrases/etc are "open" as you go.

So next time you get a parsing question, one of your first thoughts should be "use a stack!"

In this problem we can realize our stack would only hold '(' characters. So instead of storing each of those characters in a stack, we can store the number of items our stack would be holding.

That gets us from O(n)O(n) space to O(1)O(1) space.

It's pretty cool when you can replace a whole data structure with a single integer :)
