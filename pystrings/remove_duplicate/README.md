## Remove Duplicate

Remove duplicate characters in a given string keeping only the first occurrences. For example, if the input is ‘tree
traversal’ the output will be "tre avsl".

## Remove Duplicates and Sort

Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all
duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:

```python
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
```

Then, the output should be:

```python
again and hello makes perfect practice world
```

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. We use set container
to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.
