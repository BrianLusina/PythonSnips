## Remove Duplicate

Remove duplicate characters in a given string keeping only the first occurrences.
For example, if the input is ‘tree traversal’
the output will be "tre avsl".

## Remove Duplicates and Sort

Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
```python
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
```
Then, the output should be:
```python
again and hello makes perfect practice world
```

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.
