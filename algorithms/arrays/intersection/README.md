# Intersection of Two Arrays

Find the intersection between 2 arrays and return the values that intersect in a new array.
An intersection is a list of all the values that occur in both of the arrays.

For example:

```plain
a = [3,1,4,2]
b = [4,5,3,6]
intersection = [3,4]
```

## Intersection of Two Arrays I

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear
as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

```text
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

```text
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

Follow up:

- What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
- What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
- What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into
  the memory at once?

## Intersection of Two Arrays II
