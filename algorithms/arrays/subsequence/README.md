# Validate Subsequence

Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of
the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same
order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array
[1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid
subsequences of the array.

Example 1:

Input: array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], sequence = [5, 1, 22, 6, -1, 8, 10]
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10], sequence = [5, 6, 1, 10, 22, 8, -1, 25]
Output: false
