# Non-Constructible Change

Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your
possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the
minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. The given coins can have 
any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have 
multiple coins of the same value).


Sample Input:

```plain
coins = [5,7,1,1,2,3,22]
```

Sample output:

```plain
20
```
