# Minimum Moves to Spread Stones Over Grid

Given a 2D grid of integers of size (3 × 3), where each value represents the number of stones in the given cell, return 
the minimum number of moves required to place exactly one stone in each grid cell.

## Constraints

- Only one stone can be moved in one move.
- Stone from a cell can only be moved to another cell if they are adjacent (share a side).
- The sum of all stones in the grid must be equal to 9.
- `grid.length`, `grid[i].length` == 3
- 0 <= `grid[i][j]` <= 9
