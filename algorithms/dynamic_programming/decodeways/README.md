# Decode Ways

You have intercepted a secret message encoded as a string of numbers. The message is decoded via the following mapping:

```text
'1' -> "A"
'2' -> "B"
'3' -> "C"
...
'26' -> "Z"
```
However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because
some codes are contained in other codes ("2" and "5" vs "25").

For example, "11106" can be decoded into:

- "AAJF" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
- "KJF" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
- The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because "06" is not a valid code (only "6" is valid).

Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded
in any valid way, return 0.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

## Examples

Example 1

```text
Input: s = "12"

Output: 2

Explanation:

"12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```
 
Example 2

```text
Input: s = "226"

Output: 3

Explanation:

"226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

Example 3

```text
Input: s = "06"

Output: 0

Explanation:

"06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06"). In this case, the string is not
a valid encoding, so return 0.
```

Example 4

```text
s = 101
output = 1
Explanation: The only way to decode it is "JA". "01" cannot be decoded into "A" as "1" and "01" are different.
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 100
- s contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).
