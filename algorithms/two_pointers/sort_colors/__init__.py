def sort_colors(colors: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Sorts a list of 0s, 1s, and 2s in place

    This algorithm uses three pointers: low, mid, and high. The low pointer is used to track the position where the next
    0 should be placed, the mid-pointer is used to scan the list, and the high pointer is used to track the position
    where the next 2 should be placed.

    The algorithm works by iterating through the list with the mid-pointer. If it encounters a 0, it swaps it with the
    element at the low index and increments both low and mid. If it encounters a 1, it simply increments mid. If it
    encounters a 2, it swaps it with the element at the high index and decrements high (without incrementing mid,
    because the swapped element could be a 0 or a 1).

    This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for sorting lists
    of 0s, 1s, and 2s.

    Args:
        colors (list): list of 0s, 1s, and 2s
    Returns:
        list: sorted list of 0s, 1s, and 2s

    Sorts a list of 0s, 1s, and 2s in place using two pointers

    low. If it encounters a 2, it decrements high. If it encounters a 1, it swaps it with the element at the high index
