Larry has been given a permutation of a sequence of natural numbers incrementing from  1 as an array. He must determine whether the array can be sorted using the following operation any number of times:

Choose any  consecutive indices and rotate their elements in such a way that .
For example, if :

```plain
A		rotate 
[1,6,5,2,4,3]	[6,5,2]
[1,5,2,6,4,3]	[5,2,6]
[1,2,6,5,4,3]	[5,4,3]
[1,2,6,3,5,4]	[6,3,5]
[1,2,3,5,6,4]	[5,6,4]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
YES
```

On a new line for each test case, print YES if  can be fully sorted. Otherwise, print NO.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

The next  pairs of lines are as follows:

The first line contains an integer , the length of .
The next line contains  space-separated integers .
Constraints

 integers incrementing by  from  to 
Output Format

For each test case, print YES if  can be fully sorted. Otherwise, print NO.

Sample Input

3
3
3 1 2
4
1 3 4 2
5
1 2 3 5 4
Sample Output

YES
YES
NO
Explanation

In the explanation below, the subscript of  denotes the number of operations performed.

Test Case 0: 
 
 is now sorted, so we print  on a new line.

Test Case 1: 
. 
. 
 is now sorted, so we print  on a new line.

Test Case 2:
No sequence of rotations will result in a sorted . Thus, we print  on a new line.
