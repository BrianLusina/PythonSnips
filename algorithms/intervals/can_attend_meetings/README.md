# Can Attend Meetings

Write a function to check if a person can attend all the meetings scheduled without any time conflicts. Given an array 
intervals, where each element [s1, e1] represents a meeting starting at time s1 and ending at time e1, determine if
there are any overlapping meetings. If there is no overlap between any meetings, return true; otherwise, return false.

Note that meetings ending and starting at the same time, such as (0,5) and (5,10), do not conflict.

Examples:

```text
Input: intervals = [(1,5),(3,9),(6,8)]
Output: False

Explanation: The meetings (1,5) and (3,9) overlap.
```

```text
Input: intervals = [(10,12),(6,9),(13,15)]
Output: True

Explanation: There are no overlapping meetings, so the person can attend all.
```
