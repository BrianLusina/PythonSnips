Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head nodes of two linked lists. Compare the data in the nodes of the linked lists to check if they are equal. If all data attributes are equal and the lists are the same length, return True Otherwise, return False

llist1 = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL
llist2 = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL

The two lists have equal data attributes for the first 3 nodes. llist2 is longer, though, so the lists are not equal. Return False.
