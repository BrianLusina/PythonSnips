Write Number in Expanded Form
You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:


```plain
expanded_form(12) # Should return '10 + 2'
expanded_form(42) # Should return '40 + 2'
expanded_form(70304) # Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
```

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
