You will have a list of rationals in the form

m = [ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... , [numer_n, denom_n] ] or m = [ (numer_1, denom_1) , ... , (numer_n, denom_n) ]

where all numbers are positive integers. You have to produce the sum N/D of these rationals in an irreducible form ie N and D have only 1 for divisor.

The result will be written in the form

[N, D] in Ruby/Python/Clojure/JS/CS/PHP
Just "N D" in Haskell or Some "N D" in F#
"[N, D]" in Java, CSharp, TS
{N, D} in C++
{N, D} in Elixir
Example:

[ [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4] ] ----> 
[13, 12] or: Just "13 12" (Haskell) or: "[13, 12]" (Java, CSharp, TS) or: {13, 12} (C++, Elixir)
Notes:

If m is [] return

nil/None/null (Ruby/Elixir/Clojure/Python/JS/CS/TS/Java/CSharp/PHP)
Nothing (Haskell) None (F#)
{0, 1} (C++)
If D divise N return:

N/D as an integer: n (Ruby/Elixir/Clojure/Python/JS/CS/PHP)
Just "n" (Haskell), Some "n" (Haskell), "n" (Java, CSharp, TS), {n, 1} (C++).
