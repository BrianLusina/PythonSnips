# Gibonacci Sequence

This is similar to the fibonacci sequence, but this is defined as g0 = x, g1 = y and gn = gn-1 - gn-2 for n >= 2.
Different starting values of the gibonacci sequence may lead to different gibonacci sequence.

You are given 3 arguments: n, x, y, your task is to find gn using the above definition of a gibonacci sequence starting
with g0 = x, g1= y

Write a function `gibonacc(n, x, y)` that takes 3 arguments

```plain
gibonacci(0, 0, 1) = 0
gibonacci(1, 0, 1) = 1
gibonacci(2, 0, 1) = 1
gibonacci(3, 0, 1) = 0
```
