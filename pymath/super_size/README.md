## Super Size

Write a function that rearranges an interger into its largest possible value.

``` python
super_size(123456) # 654321
super_size(105)    # 510
super_size(12)     # 21
```

If the argument passed through is single digit or is already the maximum possible integer, your function should simply return it.
