ABC is a right triangle, 90 at B. Therefore, ABC = 90.

Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse AC.

You are given the lengths AB and BC. Your task is to find MBC (angle , as shown in the figure) in degrees.

Input Format

The first line contains the length of side . The second line contains the length of side .

Constraints

0 < AB < 100 0 < BC < 100

Lengths AB and BC are natural numbers. Output Format

Output MBC in degrees.

Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer.

Examples:
If angle is 56.5000001°, then output 57°. If angle is 56.5000000°, then output 57°. If angle is 56.4999999°, then output
56°.
