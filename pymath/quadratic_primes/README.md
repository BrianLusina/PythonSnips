Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:


n<sup>2</sup>+n+41

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values 0≤ n ≤ 39. However, 
when n=40, 40<sup>2</sup> + 40 + 41 = 40(40+1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n=41, 41<sup>2</sup> + 41+41 
is clearly divisible by 41.

The incredible formula n<sup>2</sup> − 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values 
0 ≤ n ≤ 79. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

n<sup>2</sup> + an + b, where |a| < 1000 and |b| ≤ 1000

where |n| is the modulus/absolute value of n

e.g. |11| = 11 and |−4| = 4

Find the product of the coefficients, a and b, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes 
for consecutive values of n, starting with n=0.
