# Plus Minus

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the
decimal value of each fraction on a new line with places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with
absolute error of up to 10^-4 are acceptable.

Example
arr = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]
There are 5 elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are 2/5 = 0.4000000, 2/5 = 0.4000000 and 1/5
= 0.2000000.

Results are as: [0.400000, 0.400000, 0.200000]
Return the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should have 6 digits after the decimal.
The function should not return a value.
