## Domestic Trade

You have been hired by a trade company to write a program. They have given you a CSV (comma separated value, used in spreadsheets) file containing sales data by transaction for 10,000 sales transactions. write a function that calculates the grand total of sales for a given item across all stores.

Your output should be in a form of a dictionary, with total_KSH as a key and the total as a value.

Additionally, the company wants to know which store location made the largest sales for that item. Add that as another hash key-value pair.

Example: Given a `TRANS.csv` of:

store,sku,amount
Nairobi,DM1210,7000 KSH
Nairobi,DM1182,1968 KSH
Naivasha,DM1182,5858 KSH
Mombasa,DM1210,6876 KSH
Nakuru,DM1182,5464 KSH

If we enter 'DM1182', you program should return:
{:total_KSH=> 13290, :largest=> 'Naivasha'}.
