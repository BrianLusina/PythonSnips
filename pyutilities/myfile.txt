 So much to say,yet it will notbe enough to describe what my squad and I went through that night. We did our daily roundsas per our duties.
 It was always cold, but today was exceptionally chilly. We joked an laughed that it was probably our captain who had entered our patrol region, we loved the guy, but he had a heart made of ice.
