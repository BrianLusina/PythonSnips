        """Reorders the edges of the directed graph represented as an adjacency list in connections such that each vertex
        is connected and has a path to the first vertex marked with 0. n represents the number of vertices.

        Complexity;
        n is the number of vertices/nodes

        Time Complexity: O(n)
            O(n) to initialize the adjacency list
            The dfs function visits each node once, which takes O(n) time in total. Because we have undirected edges,
            each edge can only be iterated twice (by nodes at the end), resulting in O(e) operations total while
            visiting all nodes, where e is the number of edges. Because the given graph is a tree, there are nâˆ’1
            undirected edges, so O(n+e)=O(n).

        Space Complexity: O(n)
            Building the adjacency list takes O(n) space.
            The recursion call stack used by dfs can have no more than n elements in the worst-case scenario.
             It would take up O(n) space in that case.

        Args:
            n(int): number of vertices or in this case, number of cities
            connections(list): adjacency matrix for a directed graph or in this case, representation of cities
        Returns:
            int: minimum number of edges to re-arrange to ensure that each vertex is directly or indirectly connected to
            the initial vertex
