# 0-1 Knapsack

Problem Description

Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.

Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.

Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

NOTE:

You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 103

1 <= C <= 103

1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 103

Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller
than or equal to C.

```plain
Example Input
Input 1:

A = [60, 100, 120]
B = [10, 20, 30]
C = 50
Input 2:

A = [10, 20, 30, 40]
B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
C = 10

Example Output
Output 1:

220
Output 2:

0

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

Taking items with weight 20 and 30 will give us the maximum value i.e 100 + 120 = 220
Explanation 2:

Knapsack capacity is 10 but each item has weight greater than 10 so no items can be considered in the knapsack therefore
answer is 0.
