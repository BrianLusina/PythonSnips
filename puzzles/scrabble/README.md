Scrabble Score

Write a program that, given a word, computes the scrabble score for that word. Letter Values

You'll need these:

Letter Value 1 A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T 1 2 D, G 2 3 B, C, M, P 3 4 F, H, V, W, Y 4 5 K 5 6 J, X 8 7 Q, Z 10

Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

     3 points for C
     1 point for A, twice
     3 points for B, twice
     2 points for G
     1 point for E

And to total:

     3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1
     = 3 + 2 + 6 + 3
     = 5 + 9
     = 14
