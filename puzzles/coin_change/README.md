# Change

Correctly determine the fewest number of coins to be given to a customer such
that the sum of the coins' value would equal the correct amount of change.

## For example

- An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) or [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
- An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

## Edge cases

- Does your algorithm work for any given set of coins?
- Can you ask for negative change?
- Can you ask for a change value smaller than the smallest coin value?

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you should write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```
