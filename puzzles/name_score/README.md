## Name Score

The 26 letters of the English alphabets are randomly divided into 5 groups of 5 letters with the remaining letter being ignored. Each of the group is assigned a score of more than 0. The ignored letter always has a score of 0.

With this kata, write a function nameScore(name) to work out the score of a name that is passed to the function.

The output should be returned as an object:

{'Mary Jane':20}
Only letters have a score. Spaces do not.

You can safely assume that name does not contain any punctuations or symbols. There will also be no empty string or null value.

A static alpha object for testing has been preloaded for your convenience in the following format:

{'ABCDE':1,'FGHIJ':2,'KLMNO':3,'PQRST':4,'UVWXY':5}  //'Z' is ignored
Note that the alpha object will be randomly generated each time you run the test.

Example

In accordance to the above alpha object, the name Mary Jane will have a name score of 20 => M=3 + a=1 + r=4 + y=5 + J=2 + a=1 + n=3 + e=1
