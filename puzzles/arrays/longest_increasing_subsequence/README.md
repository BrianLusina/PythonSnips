# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers, A.

In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequence's elements are in strictly increasing order, and in
which the subsequence is as long as possible.

In this case, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

```plain
Input 1:

A = [1, 2, 1, 5]
Output = 3
The longest increasing subsequence: [1, 2, 5]

Input 2:

A = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
Output = 6
 The possible longest increasing subsequences: [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15] or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]
 
Input 3:
arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

Input 4:
arr[] = {3, 2}
Output:1
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}

Input 5:
arr[] = {50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80}
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is {3, 7, 40, 80}
