# Integer Square Root

You are required to write a function that takes a non-negative integer, k, and returns the largest integer whose square 
is less than or equal to the specified integer k.

Example(s):

```plain
Input: 12
Output: 3
(3)^2 = 9 < 12
(4)^2 = 16 < 12
so the number 3 is the correct response
```

```plain
Input: 300
Output: 17
(17)^2 = 289 < 300
(18)^2 = 324 < 300
so the number 17 is the correct response
```
