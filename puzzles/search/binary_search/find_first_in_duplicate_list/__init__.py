    """
    Finds the first duplicate number that matches the target from the sorted numbers list. if not found, None is returned.

    This uses a linear approach to solve the problem. Which iterates through the entire list until the first occurrence
    of target is found and once found, exists immediately returning the index. If not, None is returned.

    Complexity:
    Time: O(n) as the worst case if the target is not in the number list, then the loop will go over every element in the
    list
    Space: O(1) as no extra space is allocated to handle the computation

    Args:
        numbers (list): sorted list of integers
        target (int): target number/integer being sought
    Returns:
        int or None: returns the index of the target number if found, else returns None
