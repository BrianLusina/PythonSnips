# Find First Entry in List With Duplicates

Write a function that takes an array of sorted integers and a key and returns the index of the first occurrence of that 
key from the array.

For example, for the array:

[-14, -10, 2, 108, 108, 243, 285, 285, 285, 401]

with
target = 108

the algorithm would return 3, as the first occurrence of 108 in the above array is located at index 3.
