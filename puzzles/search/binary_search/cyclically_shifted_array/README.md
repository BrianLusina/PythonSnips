# Cyclically Shifted Array

Return the index of the smallest number in a cyclically shifted array.

An array is “cyclically shifted” if it is possible to shift its entries cyclically so that it becomes sorted.

The following list is an example of a cyclically shifted array:

    A = [4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]

Below are all the possible cyclic shifts of an array:

```plain
Array A: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

[2,3,4,5,6,7,1]
[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
[3,4,5,6,7,1,2]
[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
[4,5,6,7,1,2,3]
[7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
```
