# Find the Closest Number

we will be given a sorted array and a target number. Our goal is to find a number in the array that is closest to the
target number. We will be making use of a binary search to solve this problem, so make sure that you have gone through
the previous lesson.

The array may contain duplicate values and negative numbers.

Example 1

    Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9}
    Target number = 11
    Output : 9
    9 is closest to 11 in given array

Example 2

    Input :arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9};
    Target number = 4
    Output : 5
