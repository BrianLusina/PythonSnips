## Correct The Time String

A very easy task for you!

You have to create a method, that corrects a given time string. There was a problem in addition, so many of the time strings are broken. Time-Format is european. So from "00:00:00" to "23:59:59".

Some examples:

"09:10:01" -> "09:10:01"
"11:70:10" -> "12:10:10"
"19:99:99" -> "20:40:39"
"24:01:01" -> "00:01:01"

If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value!
If the time-string-format is invalid, return null.
