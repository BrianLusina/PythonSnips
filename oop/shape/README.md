Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

Hints:

To override a method in super class, we can define a method with the same name in the super class.

Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. The Circle class has a method which can compute the area.
