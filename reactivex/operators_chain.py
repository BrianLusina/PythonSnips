"""
We can chain observables to form new observables to subscribe on. This is useful when transforming incoming data and we may want to perform
some pre-processing before we output it to a subscriber/observer.
This chaining of operations creates new observables that we can subscribe to and call the same on_next, on_completed and on_error callbacks
