Detective, we're hot on their trail! We have a big pile of encoded messages here to use as evidence, but it would take way too long to decode by hand. Could you write a program to do this for us?

Write a funciton called decode(). Given an encoded string, return the actual phone number in string form. Don't worry about input validation, parenthesies, or hyphens.
