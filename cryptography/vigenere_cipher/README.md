The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher.
The 'key' for a vigenere cipher is a key word.

Read up on Vigenère Cipher before attempting solution: http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/classical-era/vigenere-gronsfeld-and-autokey/

Example: 'DEFENDTHEEASTWALLOFTHECASTLE' encyphered with the key 'FORTIFICATIONFORTIFICATIONFO'
should return 'ISWXVIBJEXIGGBOCEWKBJEVIGGQS'

Hint: If you've done caesar cipher before, you can use the same idea here
