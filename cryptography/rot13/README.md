# ROT13

According to Wikipedia, ROT13 (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13>) is frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.

Hint: For this task you're only supposed to substitue characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers etc.

Test examples:

"EBG13 rknzcyr." -->
"ROT13 example."

"This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -->
"Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"
