Listening to messages based on a pattern with RabbitMQ

1. `emit_log_topic.py`
    Will emit log messages just like in `Routing` with the only difference being the exchange being used
    
2. `receive_log_topic.py`
    Receives log messages from the queue that have been sent by the producer
 
To receive all the logs run:
```bash
python receive_logs_topic.py "#"
```
To receive all logs from the facility "kern":
```bash
python receive_logs_topic.py "kern.*"
```
Or if you want to hear only about "critical" logs:
```bash
python receive_logs_topic.py "*.critical"
```
You can create multiple bindings:
```bash
python receive_logs_topic.py "kern.*" "*.critical"
```
And to emit a log with a routing key "kern.critical" type:
```bash
python emit_log_topic.py "kern.critical" "A critical kernel error"
```
