Description:
Your goal is to write an Event constructor function, which can be used to make event objects.

An event object should work like this:

it has a .subscribe() method, which takes a function and stores it as its handler it has an .unsubscribe() method, which
takes a function and removes it from its handlers it has an .emit() method, which takes an arbitrary number of arguments
and calls all the stored functions with these arguments As this is an elementary example of events, there are some
simplifications:

all functions are called with correct arguments (e.g. only functions will be passed to unsubscribe)
you should not worry about the order of handlers' execution the handlers will not attempt to modify an event object (
e.g. add or remove handlers)
the context of handlers' execution is not important each handler will be subscribed at most once at any given moment of
time. It can still be unsubscribed and then subscribed again
