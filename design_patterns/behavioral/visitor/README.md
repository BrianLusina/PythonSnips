# Visitor

Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new behaviors to existing class hierarchy without altering any
existing code.

Usage examples: Visitor isnâ€™t a very common pattern because of its complexity and narrow applicability.

Conceptual Example
This example illustrates the structure of the Visitor design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

What classes does it consist of?
What roles do these classes play?
In what way the elements of the pattern are related?
