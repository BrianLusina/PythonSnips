# Guess Game

For every question the player is given 2 guesses maximum, with the difficulty increasing per question and the points
also increasing.

1. If for the first question, they get it correctly the first time, they get 2 points. If the get it correctly on the
   second guess, they get 1 point. If the don't get it correctly on either guess, they get 0 points. Either way, the
   game proceeds to the next question
2. Similar case for question 2, with the points being +3 for the first guess & +2 for the second guess
3. Similar case for question 3, where the points are +4 for the first guess & +3 for the second guess.
